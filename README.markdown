Bitcask
=======

Utilities for reading the Bitcask file format. You can use this to recover
deleted values (before they are compacted), recover from a backup, list keys
to do read-repair when list-keys is malfunctioning, and so forth.

Install
-------

    $ gem install bitcask

Examples
--------

Open a bitcask.

    b = Bitcask.new '/var/lib/riak/bitcask/0'

Dump all keys and values, in cron order, excluding tombstones.
Data files go in cronological order, so this is in effect replaying history.

    b.data_files.each do |data_file|
      data_file.each do |key, value|
        next if value == Bitcask::TOMBSTONE
        puts key
        puts value
      end
    end

If you know the offset, you can retrieve it directly.

    data_file[0] # => ["key", "value"]

And step through values one by one.

    data_file.read # => [k1, v1]
    data_file.read # => [k2, v2]

Seek, rewind, and pos are also supported.

In Riak, these are erlang terms.

    b.data_files.each do |data_file|
      data_file.each do |key, value|
        next if value == Bitcask::TOMBSTONE

        bucket, key = BERT.decode key
        value = BERT.decode value

        # Store the object's value in riak
        o = riak[bucket][key]
        o.raw_data = value.last
        o.store

        # Or dump the entire value to a file for later inspection.
        FileUtils.mkdir_p(bucket)
        File.open(File.join(bucket, key), 'w') do |out|
          out.write value.to_json
        end
      end
    end

You'd be surprised how fast this is. 10,000 values/sec, easy.

Status
------

Anyone who wants to expand this, feel free. I've been using it for emergency
recovery operations, but don't plan to reimplement bitcask in Ruby myself. I
welcome pull requests.
